### installation

```bash

```

### custom configuration

grundstein needs a configuration to work.

the easiest way to get started is to perform a grundsteinlegung.

```bash
git clone git://github.com/grundstein/legung ./domain.com

cd domain.com

npm install

# start dev server
npm start

# deploy to your own server (after editing /grundstein-config.mjs to add your ip)
TBD

```

##### suggestion:

we use a digitalocean floating ip, this will allow us to seamlessly change pods later,
if there are updates to grundstein that require a reinstall.

by leaving a number of old pods alive, we can also rollback easily.
